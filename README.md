# Description

In this project, I have made predictions about the latest trends in machine learning by analyzing NIPs Dataset from Kaggle and using LDA (Latent Dirichlet allocation). 

In natural language processing, the latent Dirichlet allocation is a generative statistical model that allows sets of observations to be explained by unobserved groups that explain why some parts of the data are similar.

Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) is one of the top machine learning conferences in the world. It covers topics ranging from deep learning and computer vision to cognitive science and reinforcement learning.

This dataset includes the title, authors, abstracts, and extracted text for all NIPS papers to date (ranging from the first 1987 conference to the current 2016 conference). I've extracted the paper text from the raw PDF files and are releasing that both in CSV files and as a SQLite database. The code to scrape and create this dataset is on GitHub. Here's a quick RMarkdown exploratory overview of what's in the data.

The dataset can be found on this link: https://www.kaggle.com/benhamner/nips-papers?select=papers.csv
It's also added to the repository in Excel format. . Filename: papers.csv
